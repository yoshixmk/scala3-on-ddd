# scala3-on-ddd
WIP:  
Enjoy DDD on Scala 3. Dotty will soon be Scala 3.

## Quickstart
sbt project compiled with Dotty

```zsh
$ sbt run
```

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[dotty-example-project](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project/blob/master/README.md).

## Environment
- Visual Studio Code  
```zsh
$ sbt launchIDE
```

Currently, the only IDE we officially support is Visual Studio Code.

## About this project
As for the name, it's correct whether you enjoy 'ddd on scala3' or 'scala3 on ddd'.  
Finally, I decided with reference to [slick3-on-ddd](https://github.com/ma2k8/slick3-on-ddd) repository name
